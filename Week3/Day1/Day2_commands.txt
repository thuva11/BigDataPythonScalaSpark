Commands
1)df

The df command (short for disk free), is used to display information related to file systems about total space and available space.

df
df /home/wterry/
df -a  ->If you want to display all the file system, use -a option.
df --total  ->To get complete grand total, use –total option
du 

2)fdisk

fdisk is a menu-driven command-line utility that allows you to create and manipulate partition tables on a hard disk.
Be aware that fdisk is a dangerous tool and should be used with extreme caution. Only root or users with sudo privileges can manipulate the partition tables.

sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda

fdisk /dev/sdb

3)sfdisk

While sfdisk is similar to fdisk, there are few partition manipulation activities that are very easy to perform in sfdisk. For example, you can create new partitions in an non-interactive method using sfdisk.


sfdisk -l

sudo sfdisk -l /dev/sdd



4)cfdisk
cfdisk is used to create, delete, and modify partitions on a disk device. Enter the cfdisk command and include the device that you want to partition as an argument.

cfdisk /dev/sda


5)lsblk
Lsblk is used to display details about block devices and these block devices(Except ram disk) are basically those files that represent devices connected to the pc.

lsblk

lsblk -a  ->To display empty block devices as well.
lsblk -b  ->To print size information in bytes.

6)blkid

The blkid command allows you to display information about available block devices. To do so, type the following at a shell prompt as root
For each listed block device, the blkid command displays available attributes such as its universally unique identifier (UUID), file system type (TYPE), or volume label (LABEL).

blkid
sudo blkid /dev/sda

7)mdadm
MDADM command is used to monitor and manage software RAID devices. RAID is nothing but a technique used for Performance management and Reduce data redundancy.

The main purpose of mdadm command is to combine one or more physical disk drive components into one or more logical units.

Multiple Disk and Device Management.
Note that if you omit the --manage option, mdadm assumes management mode anyway. Keep this fact in mind to avoid running into trouble further down the road.

mdadm --manage --help

mdadm --manage RAID options devices

mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --add /dev/sdd1
mdadm --detail /dev/md0


8)chmod
In Unix-like operating systems, the chmod command is used to change the access mode of a file.
The name is an abbreviation of change mode.

The references are used to distinguish the users to whom the permissions apply i.e. they are list of letters that specifies whom to give permissions. The references are represented by one or more of the following letters:

Reference   Class     Description
u          owner      file's owner

g          group      users who are members of
                      the file's group

o          others     users who are neither the
                      file's owner nor members of 
                      the file's group

a          all       All three of the above, same as ugo


The operator is used to specify how the modes of a file should be adjusted. The following operators are accepted:

Operator  Description
+         Adds the specified modes to the
          specified classes

-         Removes the specified modes from 
          the specified classes

=         The modes specified are to be made
          the exact modes for the specified 
          classes

The modes inUse the ls -l command to find out who owns a file or what group the file belongs to:

indicate which permissions are to be granted or removed from the specified classes. There are three basic modes 
which correspond to the basic permissions:

r       Permission to read the file.
w       Permission to write (or delete) the file.
x       Permission to execute the file, or, in
        the case of a directory, search it.

ls -l

before 
drwxrwxr-x  mik   mik   EXAM

 chmod u=rw EXAM 

after
 drw-rwxr-x   mik  mik    EXAM

9)chown
The chown command allows you to change the user and/or group ownership of a given file, directory, or symbolic link.in

ls -l filename.txt


-rw-r--r-- 12 linuxize users 12.0K Apr  8 20:51 filename.txt
|[-][-][-]-   [------] [---]
                |       |

To change the owner of a file use the chown command followed by the user name of the new owner and the target file as an argument

chown USER FILE

15)nohup

nohup (No Hang Up) is a command in Linux systems that runs the process even after logging out from the shell/terminal.
