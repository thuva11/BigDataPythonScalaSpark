## Project 1
- Project 1 will be a Scala console application that is retrieving data using Hive or MapReduce. Your job is to build a real-time news analyzer. This application should allow users to view the trending topics (e.g. all trending topics for news related to "politics", "tv shows", "movies", "video games", or "sports" only [choose one topic for project]). Or it can analyze data on any topic of your choice.
- You must present a project proposal to trainer and be approved before proceeding with project. 

### MVP:
- ALL user interaction must come purely from the console application
- scrape data from datasets from an API based on your topic of choice
- Also load data from and save data to HDFS
- Your console application must:
    - query data to answer at least 6 analysis questions of your choice
    - tell a story about your dataset
    - have a login system for all users with passwords
        - 2 types of users: BASIC and ADMIN
        - Users should also be able to update username and password
- implement all CRUD operations
- implement bucketing, and partitioning
- can use hive with screenshots but make as program in 
    IntelliJ or VSCode, too with appropriate dependencies

### Stretch Goals:
- Passwords must be encrypted
- Export all results into a JSON file
- find a trend
- utilize Apache Airflow for workflow scheduling

### Presentations
- You will be asked to run an analysis using the console application on the day of the presentation, so be prepared to do so.
- We'll have 5-10 minutes a piece, so make sure your presentation can be covered in that time, focusing on the parts of your analysis you find most interesting.
