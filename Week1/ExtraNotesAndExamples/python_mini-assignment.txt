Create functions that satisfy each of the following constraints:

1) def hello_world():
Write a Python function that simply prints "Hello World!" to the console

2) def sum_Integers(a, b):
Write a Python function that returns the sum of two integers. If the two values are the same, return triple the value instead.

3) def abs_Difference(a, b):
Write a Python function that returns the absolute difference between the two numbers. 

4) def check_30(a, b):
Write a Python function that checks if either number is 30, or if their sum is 30. If so, return True. Else, return False.

5) def within_20(a):
Write a Python function that returns true if the given integer is within 20 of 100, or within 20 of 300.

6) def adverb(str):
Write a Python function that returns a new string which is the given string with the string "ly" added to the end. If the given string
already ends in "ly", return the original string.

7) def make_dict(lst_keys, lst_values):
Write a Python function that takes two lists of the same length and creates a dictionary that maps the lst_values to the lst_keys. Assume
that the lst_keys does not have any duplicate values.
