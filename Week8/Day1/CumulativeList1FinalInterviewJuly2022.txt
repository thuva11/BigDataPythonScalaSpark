Spark

What is the difference between an RDD and a dataframe?

Are RDDs mutable or immutable? Dataframes?

Spark questions
-What is an RDD
-What is a Dataframe
-What is a DataSet
-What is the difference between an RDD, DataSet and DataFrame
-Wich one is better? When would you use one or another?

Define RDD and how do you sort elements within RDD.
-create key value pairs with map then sortByKey

Define Actions in spark (commands help in transferring data from executor to driver).

What are the deploy models in Apache Spark (local (or) client mode and Cluster mode).

What is a shuffle in Spark?

What’s the difference between cluster mode and client mode on YARN?
In cluster mode, the Spark driver runs inside an application master process which is managed by YARN on the cluster, and the client can go away after initiating the application. In client mode, the driver runs in the client process, and the application master is only used for requesting resources from YARN.

What is a Spark Application? Job? Stage? Task?

What is Spark SQL?

How does a broadcast join work in Spark?
Broadcast join is an important part of Spark SQL's execution engine. When used, it performs a join on two relations by first broadcasting the smaller one to all Spark executors, then evaluating the join criteria with each executor's partitions of the other relation.

Why are broadcast joins significantly faster than shuffle joins?
When the broadcasted relation is small enough, broadcast joins are fast, as they require minimal data shuffling. Above a certain threshold however, broadcast joins tend to be less reliable or performant than shuffle-based join algorithms, due to bottlenecks in network and memory usage.

What is the catalyst optimizer?
The Catalyst optimizer is a crucial component of Apache Spark. It optimizes structural queries – expressed in SQL, or via the DataFrame/Dataset APIs – which can reduce the runtime of programs and save costs.
(logical vs physical)

Difference between dataframes and datasets?

Are Dataframes lazily evalauted, like RDDs?
DataFrame – Spark evaluates DataFrame lazily, that means computation happens only when action appears (like display result, save output)
